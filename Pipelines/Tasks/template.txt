How many times has this failed?
Is it sporadic, or all runs?
Is it happening for all users?
If using YAML pipelines, attach their final YAML by clicking "download full YAML" in the "..." menu of the pipeline editor view
If using designer (non-YAML) pipelines, have the customer export the JSON for the failing definition (at the version active at first failure) and attach to issue.
If the customer is using self-hosted Pipelines agents:
Attach a zip of the _diag folder from a machine that ran the job
If it can be reproduced again, enable agent.diagnostics to true on pipeline and HTTP\s tracing for the agent and reproduce the issue again.
Run the agent diagnostics tools from an example machine and attach the output (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/agents/v2-windows?view=azure-devops#diagnostics) 
Is the customer using a proxy?
What happens if they disable it?
Is the customer using anti-virus software?
What happens if they disable it? 
Where is the agent machine (is the agent on a VM or container)?
What kind of pool is the agent machine in? Is it a VMSS Pool? 
If the problem is related to a task failure, please collect:
Task Name and version:
Default\Custom task:
Information like when the issue started happening, was it ever working, or never worked can be useful for analysis, please provide all this detail:
Failing script (PowerShell, CMD, Bash), ARM Template, etc. (names of worker log files capturing the failure are helpful!)
Compare the successful and failure logs to check if there are any changes related to agent version, image version, task version.
If problem is related to pipelines/stages/jobs/tasks running or not, please collect: 
Is the pipeline paused? 
What are the evaluated conditions of each node in the graph? 
What are the cancelation timeouts for each node in the graph?
If it is a UI problem, please collect:
URL of the page
Screenshot or video demonstrating the issue
F12 Console output (if any)
F12 network trace or Fiddler (if helpful)

Debugging Done:
======================================

Please include all the details of what troubleshooting you have done, including:

Analysis done from any collected logs
Kusto queries run and the relevant results
Any docs that were referenced
Any suggestions/observations made by escalations
If it can be reproduced, please provide the steps to repro
If customer is using some commands or APIs, does the issue reproduce outside of the pipeline?
Logs from remote being affected (Azure web app, Cloud Service, SQL Azure, IIS, etc). You may need to collab with other CSS teams to get these.
If a collab is done with other teams, please add the detailed analysis from their side.
Logs running the same from command line in case of automated testing (also detail about test framework and versions.. )
In case of deploymentAPI failure, please also collect kudu logs on the scm site underLogFiles/Kudu/trace path
If the issue is related to retention, please provide the retention settings from pipeline definition, at org level setting for retention, pipeline stage retention settings.
